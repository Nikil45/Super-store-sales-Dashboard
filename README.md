# Super-store-sales-Dashboard

I worked on analyzing retail sales data to understand business performance, customer trends, and operational efficiency. Using Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that highlights key business metrics and provides meaningful insights.

🔹 Key Dashboards Created:
• Sales Performance Overview
• Profit and Quantity Analysis
• Delivery and Shipping Insights

🔹 Key Insights:
• The business generated Total Sales of 1.6 Million with an overall Profit of 175K.
• A total of 22K products were sold, with an Average Delivery count of 23K, indicating strong order fulfillment performance.
• COD (43%) was the most preferred payment method, followed by Online (35%) and Cards (22%).
• The Consumer segment contributed the highest sales (48%), followed by Corporate (33%) and Home Office (19%).
• Office Supplies generated the highest category sales (0.64M), followed by Technology (0.47M) and Furniture (0.45M).
• Among sub-categories, Phones recorded the highest sales, followed by Chairs and Binders.
• Standard shipping mode handled the majority of orders, showing customer preference for cost-effective delivery.
• Sales and profit trends showed noticeable growth towards the last quarter of the year, indicating strong seasonal demand.
• Regional Sales Performance: West region contributed the highest share (33%), followed by East (29%), Central (22%), and South (16%). This suggests stronger customer demand and market penetration in the Western and Eastern regions, while the Southern region shows potential growth opportunities for business expansion and targeted marketing strategies.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX, visualization, and dashboard design, while delivering actionable business insights.
